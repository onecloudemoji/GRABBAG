So. That nasty subject I avoided in uni. That topic I couldn't get any help from any of my friends except ONE. I asked a LOT of industry people I know, and they don't know networking. So despite what the internet thinks, getting my CCNA will be a big thing because not every shit eating hardware tech knows how to do it.

Let's start with some cliff notes to make sure I can pick this back up in a hurry if I ever need to.
•The last bit of the network mask (when put on the number line) is the network increment
•If you're dealing with the last octet, the first and last address of each subnet are unassignale; network ID and broadcast ID respectively
•128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1 is the number line if you ever have a stroke and forget how to function
•When determining max number of hosts or max number of subnets, octets that are "on" (255) are NOT COUNTED in the formula
•Max subnets is from LEFT to right.
•1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc doubling, can get very large
•Hosts are RIGHT to left
