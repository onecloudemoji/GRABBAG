crack private keys

use john to bruteforce the phrase on ssh keys

ssh2john privatekey > private.john
john --format=SSH private.john --wordlist /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

Crack RSA keys

ssh2john id_rsa > rsacrack


this puts the file into a format that can be worked upon

zcat /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz | john –pipe –rules rsacrack
